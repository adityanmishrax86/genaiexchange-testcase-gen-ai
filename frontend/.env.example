# Backend API Base URL
# Local development: http://localhost:8001/api (or 8000)
# Production: https://your-backend-domain/api
# Note: This is only used when VITE_USE_MOCK_API=false
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8001/api

# Mock API Configuration
# Set to 'true' to use mock API for ALL endpoints (including file uploads)
# This allows testing the entire pipeline without a real backend
# Set to 'false' to use real backend server
#
# Current Status:
#   - Mock API: FULLY FUNCTIONAL (all 6 endpoints mocked)
#   - Real Backend: Use only when backend endpoints are fully implemented
#
# Recommended: Use VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true for frontend development
VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true
