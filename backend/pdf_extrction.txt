○ Regression analysis is a documented evaluation of the impact of a software
change based on review of the relevant documentation (e.g., software
requirements specification, software design specification, source code, test plans,
test cases, test scripts, etc.) to determine whether regression testing is needed. If
regression testing is needed as determined by the regression analysis, the sponsor
should identify the necessary regression tests to be run. Regression testing is the
rerunning of test cases that a program has previously executed correctly and
comparing the current result to the previous result in order to detect unintended
effects of a software change.
System level test protocol including expected results derived from software requirements,
actual results that are observed and recorded, objective pass/fail determination (i.e.,
actual results are acceptably equivalent to expected results) and a system level test report.
The system level test report should demonstrate that the protocol has been acceptably
executed with passing test results and any unresolved anomalies have been acceptably
deferred based on a risk assessment for the candidate release version.
(2) Enhanced Documentation Level
In addition to the documentation requested for the Basic Documentation Level, all unit and
integration level test protocols and reports should be provided, including expected results derived
from software requirements and design, actual results that are observed and recorded, and
objective pass/fail determination (i.e., actual results are acceptably equivalent to expected
results). The unit and integration level test reports should demonstrate that the protocols have
been acceptably executed with passing testing results and any unresolved anomalies have been
acceptably deferred based on a risk assessment for the candidate release version.
I.
Software Version History
The documentation should include the history of software versions that were tested and
documented at the unit, integration, and system levels as part of verification and validation
activities, beginning with the version that became subject to the design controls, as described in
21 CFR 820.30. This typically takes the form of a line-item tabulation including the date, version
number that was tested (including, if applicable, bench, animal, and clinical testing) and a brief
description of all changes in the version relative to the previously tested version.
The last entry in a line-item tabulation should be the final version to be incorporated in the
released device. This entry should also include any differences between the tested version of
software and the released version, along with an assessment of the potential effect of the
differences on the safety and effectiveness of the device.
If the software version history includes a version(s) that corresponds to a previously released
cleared or approved version of the software, the sponsor should highlight in the version history
document each prior released cleared or approved version and the premarket submission
number(s) associated with that release.

If the device is a multiple function device product and includes software function(s) that are
considered "other functions,” as that term is used in the guidance “Multiple Function Device
Products: Policy and Considerations," the recommendations described in the aforementioned
guidance should be considered when preparing the software version history.
J.
Unresolved Software Anomalies
An anomaly is any condition that deviates from the expected behavior based on user needs,
requirements, specifications, design documents, or standards. Anomalies may be found during
the review, test, analysis, compilation, or use of the software (whether before or after release, or
whether inside a sponsor's organization or outside it) or at other times. An unresolved software
anomaly is a defect that still resides in the software because a sponsor deemed it appropriate not
to correct or fix the anomaly, according to a risk-based rationale about its impact to the device's
safety and effectiveness.
A list of unresolved anomalies should document the following items (e.g., in tabular format) for
each unresolved anomaly present in the software:
•
A description of the anomaly;
Identification of how the anomaly was discovered and, where possible, identification of
the root cause(s) of the anomaly;
•
Evaluation of the impact of the anomaly on the device's safety and effectiveness,
including operator usage and human factors considerations;
• Outcome of the evaluation; and
•
Risk-based rationale for not correcting or fixing the anomaly in alignment with the
sponsor's risk management plan or procedure(s).
Additionally, the Agency recommends considering the utilization of a defect classification
system, or taxonomy, for each anomaly, such as ANSI/AAMI SW91's Classification of defects
in health software. 58 Regardless of the defect classification system used, the sponsor should
evaluate the impact of an unresolved anomaly on the device's safety and effectiveness based on
the software's intended use.
Where appropriate, a sponsor should communicate to end users any mitigations or possible
work-arounds for unresolved anomalies to assist in the proper operation of the device to fulfill its
intended use. FDA recommends that any planned or already distributed communication
58 As stated in ANSI/AAMI SW91, a defect classification system, or taxonomy, is used to classify or categorize the
types of defects that might exist in software. A defect classification system is neutral with respect to programming
language, methodology, product, intended use, risk (severity of anomalies), and regulatory status.

(customer notification, labeling, etc.) to end users regarding unresolved anomalies is referenced
in the premarket submission.
VII. Additional Information - Regulatory Considerations for
Software Functions
Section 3060(a) of the Cures Act amended section 520 of the FD&C Act on December 13, 2016,
removing certain software functions from the definition of device in section 201(h) of the FD&C
Act. Sponsors should consider the following reference materials to learn more about FDA's

Appendix A: Documentation Level Examples
The following list of example devices is intended to demonstrate the implementation of the
Documentation Level risk-based approach. Please note that these generalized examples do not
necessarily account for every possible detail, risk, or consideration a sponsor should evaluate,
and should not be taken to mean that the devices described do or do not require a certain
Documentation Level. These examples do not define the appropriate Documentation Level for a
particular device type. As such, the Documentation Level should be uniquely considered for each
particular device or device modification and in consideration of the device's intended use. The
rationales in the examples below are abbreviated and FDA encourages sponsors to provide a
detailed assessment that accounts for the specifics of their device (such as the device's risk
assessment, 65 software description, etc.) when addressing the recommendations in Sections V
and VI.A of this guidance.

○ Regression analysis is a documented evaluation of the impact of a software
change based on review of the relevant documentation (e.g., software
requirements specification, software design specification, source code, test plans,
test cases, test scripts, etc.) to determine whether regression testing is needed. If
regression testing is needed as determined by the regression analysis, the sponsor
should identify the necessary regression tests to be run. Regression testing is the
rerunning of test cases that a program has previously executed correctly and
comparing the current result to the previous result in order to detect unintended
effects of a software change.
System level test protocol including expected results derived from software requirements,
actual results that are observed and recorded, objective pass/fail determination (i.e.,
actual results are acceptably equivalent to expected results) and a system level test report.

been acceptably executed with passing testing results and any unresolved anomalies have been
acceptably deferred based on a risk assessment for the candidate release version.
I.
Software Version History
The documentation should include the history of software versions that were tested and
documented at the unit, integration, and system levels as part of verification and validation
activities, beginning with the version that became subject to the design controls, as described in
21 CFR 820.30. This typically takes the form of a line-item tabulation including the date, version
number that was tested (including, if applicable, bench, animal, and clinical testing) and a brief
description of all changes in the version relative to the previously tested version.
The last entry in a line-item tabulation should be the final version to be incorporated in the
released device. This entry should also include any differences between the tested version of
software and the released version, along with an assessment of the potential effect of the
differences on the safety and effectiveness of the device.
If the software version history includes a version(s) that corresponds to a previously released
cleared or approved version of the software, the sponsor should highlight in the version history
document each prior released cleared or approved version and the premarket submission
number(s) associated with that release.

If the device is a multiple function device product and includes software function(s) that are
considered "other functions,” as that term is used in the guidance “Multiple Function Device
Products: Policy and Considerations," the recommendations described in the aforementioned
guidance should be considered when preparing the software version history.
J.
Unresolved Software Anomalies
An anomaly is any condition that deviates from the expected behavior based on user needs,
requirements, specifications, design documents, or standards. Anomalies may be found during
the review, test, analysis, compilation, or use of the software (whether before or after release, or
whether inside a sponsor's organization or outside it) or at other times. An unresolved software
anomaly is a defect that still resides in the software because a sponsor deemed it appropriate not
to correct or fix the anomaly, according to a risk-based rationale about its impact to the device's
safety and effectiveness.
A list of unresolved anomalies should document the following items (e.g., in tabular format) for
each unresolved anomaly present in the software:
•
A description of the anomaly;
Identification of how the anomaly was discovered and, where possible, identification of
the root cause(s) of the anomaly;
•
Evaluation of the impact of the anomaly on the device's safety and effectiveness,
including operator usage and human factors considerations;
• Outcome of the evaluation; and
•
Risk-based rationale for not correcting or fixing the anomaly in alignment with the
sponsor's risk management plan or procedure(s).
Additionally, the Agency recommends considering the utilization of a defect classification
system, or taxonomy, for each anomaly, such as ANSI/AAMI SW91's Classification of defects
in health software. 58 Regardless of the defect classification system used, the sponsor should
evaluate the impact of an unresolved anomaly on the device's safety and effectiveness based on
the software's intended use.
Where appropriate, a sponsor should communicate to end users any mitigations or possible
work-arounds for unresolved anomalies to assist in the proper operation of the device to fulfill its
intended use. FDA recommends that any planned or already distributed communication
58 As stated in ANSI/AAMI SW91, a defect classification system, or taxonomy, is used to classify or categorize the
types of defects that might exist in software. A defect classification system is neutral with respect to programming
language, methodology, product, intended use, risk (severity of anomalies), and regulatory status.

(customer notification, labeling, etc.) to end users regarding unresolved anomalies is referenced
in the premarket submission.
VII. Additional Information - Regulatory Considerations for
Software Functions
Section 3060(a) of the Cures Act amended section 520 of the FD&C Act on December 13, 2016,
removing certain software functions from the definition of device in section 201(h) of the FD&C
Act. Sponsors should consider the following reference materials to learn more about FDA's
regulatory considerations for software functions:

Appendix A: Documentation Level Examples
The following list of example devices is intended to demonstrate the implementation of the
Documentation Level risk-based approach. Please note that these generalized examples do not
necessarily account for every possible detail, risk, or consideration a sponsor should evaluate,
and should not be taken to mean that the devices described do or do not require a certain
Documentation Level. These examples do not define the appropriate Documentation Level for a
particular device type. As such, the Documentation Level should be uniquely considered for each
particular device or device modification and in consideration of the device's intended use. The
rationales in the examples below are abbreviated and FDA encourages sponsors to provide a
detailed assessment that accounts for the specifics of their device (such as the device's risk
assessment, 65 software description, etc.) when addressing the recommendations in Sections V
and VI.A of this guidance.
