# Automating Test Case Generation with AI

Develop an AI-powered system that automatically converts healthcare software requirements into compliant, traceable test cases integrated with enterprise toolchains.

## Challenge

Healthcare software development is constrained by complex regulatory requirements, diverse data formats, and the heavy burden of manual test creation. QA teams spend enormous time converting specifications into test cases, ensuring compliance, and maintaining traceability across tools. This slows product cycles and limits scalability in a highly regulated domain where precision and compliance are critical.

## Objective

Build an AI-powered system that autonomously generates test cases from requirements and specifications, reducing manual testing effort while ensuring compliance, scalability, and integration with existing enterprise toolchains.

## Solution Capabilities:

    Automate Test Case Generation:Convert natural language and structured specifications into test cases and datasets across multiple formats (PDF, Word, XML, Markup).

    Understand Complex Requirements:Accurately interpret healthcare-specific regulations and domain-heavy specifications.
    Integrate with Toolchains:Seamlessly connect with ALM platforms such as Jira, Polarion, and Azure DevOps.

    Ensure Compliance & Traceability:Support FDA, IEC 62304, ISO 9001, ISO 13485, and ISO 27001 standards with full requirement-to-test traceability.

    Enable GDPR-Compliant Pilots:Provide readiness for GDPR-compliant Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to demonstrate solution scalability.

Tech Stack:Use of Google AI technologies (Gemini, Vertex AI, BigQuery, Firebase, Agent Builder).
